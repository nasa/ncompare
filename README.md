Compare the structure of two NetCDF files at the command line.
`ncompare` generates a view of the matching and non-matching groups and variables between two NetCDF datasets.


## Installing
_____
### Using pip

Install the latest version of the package from PyPI using pip:
```shell
pip install ncompare
```

### Other methods:

For local development, one can clone the repository and then use poetry or pip from the local directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nasa/ncompare.git
```

###### (Option A) using poetry:
ii) Follow the instructions for installing `poetry` [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

iii) Run ```poetry install``` from the repository directory.

###### (Option B) using pip:

ii) Run ```pip install .``` from the repository directory.

## Usage
_____

```shell
ncompare <netcdf file #1> <netcdf file #2>
```

For example:

```shell
ncompare S001G01.nc S001G01_SUBSET.nc -g product -v ozone_profile --report subset_comparison.txt
```

###### Or, If installed using a `poetry` environment:
```shell
poetry run ncompare <netcdf file #1> <netcdf file #2>
```

**A more complete usage demonstration with example output is shown in
[this example notebook](https://nasa.github.io/ncompare/ncompare-example-usage.html).**

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`            show this help message and exit
- `--file-text` [FILE_PATH]: Text file to write output to.
- `--file-csv` [FILE_PATH]: Comma-separated values (CSV) file to write output to.
- `--file-xlsx` [FILE_PATH]: Excel file to write output to.
- `--no-color` : Turn off all colorized output.
- `--show-attributes` : Include variable attributes in the table that compares variables.
- `--show-chunks` : Include chunk sizes in the table that compares variables.
- `-v` (`--comparison_var_name`) [VAR_NAME]: Compare specific values for this variable.
- `-g` (`--comparison_var_group`) [VAR_GROUP]: Group that contains the `comparison_var_name`.
- `--column-widths` [WIDTH, WIDTH, WIDTH]: Width, in number of characters, of the three columns in the comparison report

## How to test ncompare locally

If installed using a `poetry` environment, the tests can be run with:
```
poetry run pytest tests
```

## Motivation
_____
The `cdo` (climate data operators) tool
[does not support NetCDF4 groups](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/boards/2/topics/12073).
Moreover, `nco` operators' `ncdiff` function computes value differences, but
--- as far as the developers of this tool are aware ---
`nco` does not have a simple function to show structural differences between NetCDF4 datasets.
 Note that `h5diff`, provided in the HDF5 software, can also be used to find differences.
In comparison to `h5diff`, `ncompare` is written and runnable in Python; `ncompare` provides _aligned_ and
_colorized_ difference report for quicker assessments of groups, variable names, types, shapes, and attributes;
and can generate report files formatted for other applications. However, note that
`h5diff` provides comparison of some otherwise "hidden" hdf5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates,
which are not currently assessed by `ncompare`.

## Known limitations
_____
- `ncompare` uses `xarray` to access the root-level dimensions.
In some cases, `xarray` will miss dimensions whose names do not also exist as variable names in the dataset
  (also known as non-coordinate dimensions).
- Some underlying HDF5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates, are not currently assesssed by `ncompare`.
