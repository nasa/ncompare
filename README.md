Compare the structure of two NetCDF files at the command line or via Python.
`ncompare` generates a view of the matching and non-matching groups and variables between two NetCDF datasets.


## Installing

The latest release of `ncompare` can be installed with `mamba`, `conda` or `pip`:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge ncompare
```
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ncompare
```
```bash
pip install ncompare
```

## Usage Examples

### At a command line:
To compare two netCDF files,
pass the filepaths for each of the two netCDF files directly to ncompare, as follows:

```console
ncompare <netcdf file #1> <netcdf file #2>
```

With an additional `--file-text` argument specified,
a common use of _ncompare_ may look like this example:

```console
ncompare S001G01.nc S001G01_SUBSET.nc --file-text subset_comparison.txt
```

### In a Python kernel:

```python
from ncompare import compare

total_number_of_differences = compare(
    "<netcdf file 1>", 
    "<netcdf file 2>", 
    only_diffs=True,
    show_attributes=True,
    show_chunks=True,
)
```


### More complete usage demonstrations, with example output, are shown in [this example notebook](https://ncompare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/ncompare-example-usage/).

### Developing

Development within this repository should occur on a feature branch.
Pull Requests (PRs) are created with a target of the `develop` branch before being reviewed and merged.

### Installing locally

For local development, one can clone the repository and then use poetry or pip from the local directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/nasa/ncompare.git
```

###### (Option A) using poetry:
ii) Follow the instructions for installing `poetry` [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

iii) Run ```poetry install``` from the repository directory.

###### (Option B) using pip:

ii) Run ```pip install .``` from the repository directory.


### Testing locally

If installed using a `poetry` environment, the tests can be run with:
```console
poetry run pytest tests
```

Or from another virtual environment, one can use:
```console
pytest tests
```

### To run as a locally installed poetry module

```console
poetry run ncompare <netcdf file #1> <netcdf file #2>
```


## Why ncompare?

The `cdo` (climate data operators) tool
[does not support NetCDF4 groups](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/boards/2/topics/12073).
Moreover, `nco` operators' `ncdiff` function computes value differences, but
--- as far as the developers of this tool are aware ---
`nco` does not have a simple function to show structural differences between NetCDF4 datasets.
 Note that `h5diff`, provided in the HDF5 software, can also be used to find differences.
In comparison to `h5diff`, `ncompare` is written and runnable in Python; `ncompare` provides _aligned_ and
_colorized_ difference report for quicker assessments of groups, variable names, types, shapes, and attributes;
and can generate report files formatted for other applications. However, note that
`h5diff` provides comparison of some otherwise "hidden" hdf5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates,
which are not currently assessed by `ncompare`.

## Known limitations

- `ncompare` uses `xarray` to access the root-level dimensions.
In some cases, `xarray` will miss dimensions whose names do not also exist as variable names in the dataset
  (also known as non-coordinate dimensions).
- Some underlying HDF5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates, are not currently assesssed by `ncompare`.
