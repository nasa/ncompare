abstract = {The netCDF Operator (NCO) software facilitates manipulation and analysis of gridded geoscience data stored in the self-describing netCDF format. NCO is optimized to efficiently analyze large multi-dimensional data sets spanning many files. Researchers and data centers often use NCO to analyze and serve observed and modeled geoscience data including satellite observations and weather, air quality, and climate forecasts. NCO's functionality includes shared memory threading, a message-passing interface, network transparency, and an interpreted language parser. NCO treats data files as a high level data type whose contents may be simultaneously manipulated by a single command. Institutions and data portals often use NCO for middleware to hyperslab and aggregate data set requests, while scientific researchers use NCO to perform three general functions: arithmetic operations, data permutation and compression, and metadata editing. We describe NCO's design philosophy and primary features, illustrate techniques to solve common geoscience and environmental data analysis problems, and suggest ways to design gridded data sets that can ease their subsequent analysis.}

abstract = {TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City, Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (~2.1km N/S×4.4km E/W at 36.5°N, 100°W). TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies. TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide), water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides these near-real-time air quality products that will be made publicly available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.}
